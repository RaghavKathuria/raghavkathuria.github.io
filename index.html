<p>Hello!  I am Raghav Kathuria. I am 13 years old, studying in class 8 in Springdales School, Pusa Road. I am very good in studies, art and Sports. My favourite subject is Mathematics. I also like to study books on Science and try my hands on experiments. I have taken German as my third language in School. The great Mathematician Ramanujan is my role model. I like to play many games but Cricket is my favourite Sport. I also love to play chess with my friends. I am very much fond of doing coding. So I have opted to take up the Java Script course at CODE WIZARDS during my summer vacations. Here I am having fun as well as learning html, css and java script.Thanks for visiting my website! Regards. </p>
